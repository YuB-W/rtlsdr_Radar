# RTL-SDR Radar

**RTL-SDR Radar** is a Python-based project that leverages RTL-SDR (Software Defined Radio) technology to detect human movement through radio frequency signals. By analyzing the Doppler effect caused by motion, this project can identify the presence of humans within a specified area.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Monitors and identifies human movement in real-time using radio frequency signals.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Uses a pre-trained machine learning model (`human_detection_model.pkl`) to accurately classify human presence.
- **Data Normalization**: Incorporates a scaler (`scaler.pkl`) to normalize input data, ensuring consistent and reliable detection performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [pyrtlsdr](https://pyrtlsdr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

Ensure you have an RTL-SDR device properly connected and configured on your system. For setup instructions, refer to the [RTL-SDR Quick Start Guide](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-quick-start-guide/).

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository


git clone https://github.com/YuB-W/rtlsdr_Radar.git
cd rtlsdr_Radar
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: If requirements.txt is not provided, manually install the required packages:

bash
Copy
pip install pyrtlsdr numpy scikit-learn
3. Connect the RTL-SDR Device
Ensure your RTL-SDR device is connected to your system and properly configured. Refer to the RTL-SDR Quick Start Guide for detailed setup instructions.

Usage
To start the human detection radar, run:

bash
Copy
python rtlsdr_radar.py
The script will initialize the RTL-SDR device, capture radio frequency signals, and process them to detect human movement. Detection results will be displayed in the console.

How It Works
Signal Acquisition: The RTL-SDR device captures radio frequency signals within a specified range.
Preprocessing: Captured signals are processed and normalized using the provided scaler (scaler.pkl).
Feature Extraction: Relevant features are extracted from the processed signals to highlight patterns indicative of human movement.
Classification: The pre-trained machine learning model (human_detection_model.pkl) analyzes the features to determine the presence of human movement.
Training the Model
If you wish to train the model with new data:

Data Collection: Use the RTL-SDR device to collect raw signal data corresponding to human movement and non-movement scenarios.
Feature Extraction: Process the raw data to extract meaningful features.
Normalization: Apply scaling to the features using a scaler (e.g., scaler.pkl).
Model Training: Train a machine learning model (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) using the normalized features.
Save the Model: Save the trained model as human_detection_model.pkl for use in the detection script.
For detailed guidance on training machine learning models, refer to the scikit-learn documentation.

### Key Fixes:
1. **Corrected Installation Section**: Removed unnecessary content and organized the installation steps into distinct sub-sections.
2. **Usage Instructions**: Clearly outlined how to run the script to start the radar.
3. **Training Instructions**: Explained the process of training a model more clearly and with proper formatting.
4. **Formatting Consistency**: Improved markdown formatting for better readability and structure.

This version should be easy to follow and present the necessary information to users effectively.
